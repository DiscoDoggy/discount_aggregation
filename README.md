# Aggregated Discount Viewing
## Why?
As someone who, from time to time, explores online shopping for clothing, I have often found myself wanting to figure out
what is on discount/sale from multiple stores. Currently, to figure out what sales exist, I would have to go to every stores'
website and see whats on sale manually which takes a lot of time. 

This application is a way to aggregate data from multiple different clothing line stores and bring them into one place/website
so it is easier to browser discount/onsale items.
